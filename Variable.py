# line1 = "#########"
# line2="             "
# line3="venky"   reuse the variable for better effiecient to avoid memory crash for 
# better time complexity and space someplixty

# above things are the statements
# print(line1)
# print(line2)
# print(line3)
# print(line2)
# print(line1)

# Indentation
